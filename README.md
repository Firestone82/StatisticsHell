# Project for PS: Statistics analysis based on graphic card patch
- Author: Pavel Mikula (MIK0486)
- Estimated Time Spent: ~20 hours

## Project Overview
In the data file, performance scores (FPS) are recorded for four popular graphics cards: Nvidia RTX 2080 Ti, Nvidia RTX 3070 Ti, AMD Radeon RX 6800 XT, and AMD Radeon RX 7700 XT. These cards were tested in the game Cyberpunk 2077 in two different versions: the original release and after applying the 1.5 patch. Your task is to analyze how the 1.5 patch affected the performance scores of these cards in the game. For each unique tested system (test), both versions of the game were tested.
